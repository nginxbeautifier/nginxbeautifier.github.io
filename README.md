Tiny project name: NGINX config beautifier.

Main goal:
Tiny idea validation in 2 weeks.

Plan:
- Build a tool. 4 days.
- Find good places to share the tool. 3 days.
- I want to archive at least 250 visitors. 7 days.

Description: A simple tool to beatify NGINX config files. I'll use Google Analytics to measure visitors. I'll host the app on GitHub. Here is a GitHub link https://github.com/nginxbeautifier/nginxbeautifier.github.io. The app would be available here https://nginxbeautifier.online or here https://nginxbeautifier.github.io.

Why: I want to try build in public.

Any comments are welcome!
